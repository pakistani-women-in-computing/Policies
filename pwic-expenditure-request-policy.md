# Expenditure Request Policy

Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC) may provide additional funding for projects, programs, enrichment, training or items which support our organization's goals and are outside the current budget.  These requests will be reviewed by the Finance Committee prior to being brought to the board for a vote.   

## The Expenditure Review Committee:  

- Will act as a sounding board prior to any financial requests submitted to the entire PWiC Board. 
- Will ensure that financial requests are complete. 
- Are not responsible for final decisions regarding proposals. 
 
The Expenditure Review Committee (ERC) will consist of a minimum of 2 executive board members including at least one Treasurer.  The committee may also include PWiC members. 

Please contact treasurer@pwic.org with interest.

The makeup of the committee can change as needed and should not include any person with a request being reviewed that month. 

The ERC will meet on the need basis, to review expenditure proposals. The Treasurer will schedule the meeting.   

The ERC will present those proposals at the next board meeting. The Board will vote on the proposals and shall act in accordance with the Standing Rules to implement any approved proposals. 

Completed proposals are to be delivered, in writing or sent via email, to the Treasurers by the end of each month, to be considered that month.  

All funding requests over $200 that are not in the approved budget must go through this process.
